            <p>Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. It is a good idea to try this example in your browser to see the effect.
To control where the fixed position box appears in relation to the browser window, the box offset properties are used.
