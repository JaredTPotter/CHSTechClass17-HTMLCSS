                        We will be traveling as a school to Great Britain/France in less than 2 weeks. The main goal will be to create a webpage that contains all of my travels and activities that happened. Hopefully we will see some amazing sights. I'm looking forward to going back to the Notre Dame Cathedral, The Louvre, and The Eiffel Tower. Something that I have not yet done is visit the Palace of Versailles, something we will do this time.
