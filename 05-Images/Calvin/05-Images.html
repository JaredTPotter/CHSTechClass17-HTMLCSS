            <p> Potatoes are great they are a thing that you eat with your mouth and sometimes they're dirty, sometimes they're not. If they're dirty you might not want to eat them, because that would be like eating dirt, with some potatoes on the side. You wouldn't want to do that would you?<img src="potatoes.jpg"/></p>
