            A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
            
            A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
            War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
            into infinity.
            
            It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
            striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
            victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
            
            During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
            secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
            Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
            power to destroy an entire planet.
            
            Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess                                
            Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
            the stolen plans that can save her people and
            restore freedom to the galaxy...
            
            The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
            eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
            silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
            from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
            by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
            laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
            the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
